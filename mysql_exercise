question 4
select gene_name, (seq_region_end - seq_region_start +1) as length from gene order by length limit 1;

question 5
select biotype,count(*) from gene group by biotype order by count(*) desc limit 1;

question 6
select chromosome, count(*) from gene where description like "%cancer%" group by chromosome order by count(*) desc limit 1 offset 1;

select transcript.transcript_id, count(*) as "exons" from transcript left join gene on transcript.gene_id = gene.gene_id
left join exon_transcript on transcript.transcript_id=exon_transcript.transcript_id
left join exon on exon_transcript.exon_id=exon.exon_id where chromosome="9";

question 7
select count(*) from exon;

select count(*) from exon_transcript;

some exons can have multiple transcripts
