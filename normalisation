Normalise this data up to 3NF, taking in to account these constraints:

    Each personnel number is unique
    Each lab has a single lab code
    Each research project has a single code and supervisor
    Each member of the personnel may work on one or more research projects
    Personnel names need not necessarily be unique
    Research code, description and supervisor are repeating fields

UNF: write everything together in a line
	research(personelno, name, birth, labcode, labname, research code, research descr, research supervisor)

1NF: eliminate repeating groups, separate table and id the primary key (PK)
	personel(personelno(PK), name, birth, labcode, labname)
	research(personelno(PK), research code(PK), research descr, research supervisor)

2NF: non prime attributes of the table is dependat on the primary keys)
	personel(personelno(PK), name, birth, labcode(PK))
	lab(labcode(PK), labname)
	research(personelno(PK), research code(PK), research descr, research supervisor)

3NF: non prime attributes is dependant on every key.
	personel(personelno(PK), name, birth, labcode(PK))
        lab(labcode(PK), labname)
	research(personelno(PK), research code(PK))
	research2(research code(PK), research descr, research supervisor)
